# ADC-on-TelosB
The code is to configure ADC on TelosB in Contiki so that it can measure and store the energy amount of a motion energy harvester Ampy Move.

The data can be later collected from TelosB via USB connection.

The function to download data from TelosB should be in the same program with ADC?
